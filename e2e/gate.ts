/**
 * Shared machinery for the WCAG gate.
 *
 * Three rules govern everything here:
 *
 *  1. NOTHING IS INJECTED INTO THE PAGE BEFORE A SCAN. The previous version of
 *     this gate pushed `*, *::before, *::after { animation: none !important;
 *     transition: none !important; opacity: 1 !important; }` before running
 *     axe. The `opacity` clause does not suppress a check, it FABRICATES THE
 *     INPUT: partial opacity is real rendering, and forcing a partly-
 *     transparent element opaque hands axe a foreground colour the page never
 *     paints. On this page it was worse than hypothetical — the three-act
 *     strip's `.act-card` panels render at `opacity: 0` outside their
 *     animation window, and the injection painted all three fully opaque on
 *     top of each other, a frame no visitor ever sees. It is deleted rather
 *     than replaced. Motion is settled honestly instead (see `settle`), and
 *     the composite-aware arithmetic in contrast.ts measures the colours the
 *     page actually paints, at the opacity it actually paints them.
 *
 *     The old gate also force-opened every <details> and stripped inline
 *     `display: none` before its only two scans. Every one of those states is
 *     reachable by a click, and this gate reaches them that way instead.
 *
 *  2. EVERY SCAN ASSERTS ITS CONTENT IS PRESENT FIRST, and there are scans
 *     well past first paint. axe over an empty container passes having
 *     checked nothing, and on this page the interesting containers start
 *     empty: the adversary's store holds no sessions, so there is no capture
 *     table, no RECOVERED/NOT RECOVERED verdicts and no run summary; the quiz
 *     has no answers, so no correct/wrong palette exists; every disclosure is
 *     closed. The states worth scanning are all downstream of a click.
 *
 *  3. `violations` IS NOT THE WHOLE ORACLE. See `scan`.

 * Wait for every running animation and transition to drain.

 * right now" can exit through a gap between waves. Require quiescence to hold

 *
 * The 20s ceiling is deliberately generous rather than tight: on a loaded
 * machine the raf cadence stretches, and the correct response to that is a
 * longer wait, never a narrower scan.

 *  - `incomplete` — axe's "could not decide" bucket, which never reaches the
 *    violations array. The one rule id allowed to remain incomplete is
 *    `color-contrast`, and only because the next assertion computes those
 *    ratios arithmetically — this page's body paints radial and linear
 *    gradients behind translucent panels, so axe declines a large share of
 *    its contrast decisions here. The exemption is one rule id rather than a
 *    blanket pass because real defects hide in this bucket: elsewhere in the
 *    fleet, `aria-prohibited-attr` on role-less divs sat in `incomplete` for
 *    the entire life of a violations-only gate.
 *  - arithmetic contrast — composite-aware WCAG 1.4.3 over every text node,
 *    measured against the surface the text is genuinely painted on. This is
 *    the assertion that caught the Q-Day band's stale light-theme override,
 *    which axe had filed under incomplete on every scan (gradient backdrop).
 *  - keyboard reachability of scrolling regions — WCAG 2.1.1.

 * `::before` glyph, because a pseudo-element is not an element and owns no text
 * node. Both were being found by hand-sampling screenshot pixels, which does
 * not regress-test.
 *
 * The backlog is real, so this does not block on it — but a check that merely
 * logs is not a gate, and this sweep has spent its whole length deleting checks
 * that could not fail. So it ratchets instead: anything NOT in the baseline
